# Supervised Learning with scikit-learn

## Supervised Learning vs Unsupervised Learning

Supervised learning uses labeled data and when there are no labeled data, we call it unsupervised learning.

### **Supervised learning**

In supervised learning we have Predictor variables / features and a target variable.

Goal: 

* Make future predictions \(Predict the target variable, given the predictor variables., say will a customer click on an add or not?\)
* Automate time-consuming task \(doctor's diagnosis\)

| **Task type** | **Target variable** |
| :--- | :--- |
| Classification | is categorical \(spam or legit\) |
| Regression | is continuous \(like price of houses\) |

#### **Supervised learning Requirements**

For supervised learning you need labeled data 

* Historical data with labels
* Experiments to get labeled data \(see how many click a page gets\)

There are many ways to do supervised learning in python. One of the powerful libraries is scikit learn or sklearn.

Other libraries are: TensorFlow and Keras



### **Unsupervised learning**

Uncovering hidden patterns from unlabeled data.

* Grouping customers into distinct categories \(clustering\) based on their purchasing behavior without knowing in advance what these categories maybe. This is known as clustering \(just of the branches of unsupervised learning\)

### **Reinforcement learning**

This is where machines interact with an environment. These reinforcement learning agents can optimize their behavior based on a given system of rewards and punishments. Similar to what google GO project was able to achieve playing GO.
