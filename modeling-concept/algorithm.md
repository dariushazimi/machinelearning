### Algorithm vs Heuristic

### Linear Learner Algorithm

Linear learner works pretty good when we have continues data like

```text
(34, 4, 545, 45, 23, 435, 23, 2, 44, ...)
```

But when we have have a sparse dataset we can use Factorization Machines \(it is a supervised learning\)

### Considerations for Factorization Machines Algorithm

### Use case for Factorization machines 

#### High dimensional Sparse Data Sets:

Example: click-stream data on which ads on a webpage tend to be clicked given known information about he person viewing the page

### Recommendations

Example: What sort of movies should we recommend to a person who has watched and rated some other movies?
