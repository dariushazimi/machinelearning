### AWS Mechanical Turk

The name Mechanical Turk was inspired by "[The Turk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Turk)", an 18th-century chess-playing [automaton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automaton) made by [Wolfgang von Kempelen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolfgang_von_Kempelen) that toured Europe, beating both [Napoleon Bonaparte](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Napoleon_Bonaparte) and [Benjamin Franklin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benjamin_Franklin). It was later revealed that this "machine" was not an automaton at all, but was, in fact, a human [chess master](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chess_master) hidden in the cabinet beneath the board and controlling the movements of a humanoid dummy. Likewise, the Mechanical Turk online service uses remote human labour hidden behind a computer interface to help employers perform tasks that are not possible using a true machine.
