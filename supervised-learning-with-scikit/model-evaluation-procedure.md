# Model evaluation procedure

* How do I choose **which model to use** for my supervised learning task?
* How do I choose the **best tuning parameters** for that model?
* How do I estimate the **likely performance of my model** on out-of-sample data?

Previously we looked at a 3 different models:

* Classification task: Predicting the species of an unknown iris
* Used three classification models: KNN \(K=1\), KNN \(K=5\), logistic regression
* Need a way to choose between the models

**Solution:** Model evaluation procedures
