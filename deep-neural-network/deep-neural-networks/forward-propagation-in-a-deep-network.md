# Parameters vs Hyperparameters

Parameters of your model include W\(1\), b\(1\), etc... but there are other parameters which are called hyperparameters and play a key role in the model as well.

Examples are hyperparameters are:

* Learning rate alpha \(a\)
* Number of iterations
* Number of hidden layer L
* hidden units, n\(super1\), n\(super 2\), ....
* Choice of your activation function

these are all parameters that control W and B so we call these hyper parameters because it is the hyper parameters that somehow determine the final value of the parameters W and B that you end up with.
