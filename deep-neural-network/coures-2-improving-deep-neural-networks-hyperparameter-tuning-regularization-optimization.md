# Coures: 2 Improving Deep Neural Networks: Hyperparameter tuning, Regularization optimization

## Setting up your ML Application Train/dev/test sets

When setting up the NN we have to make a lot of decision in terms of:

* \#of layers we need
* \#of hidden units
* ? learning rate
* ? are the activation functions we need to use for different layers?

When starting out with a new application, it is almost impossible to come up with the right numbers/answers on the first attempt. So in practice applying ML is a highly iterative process, from Idea -&gt; code -&gt; experiment and based on the outcome of the experiment we refine the idea to come up with a better and better network.

**Success Factors:**

When setting up your ML, set it up in a train/dev/test model and choose a ratio that is appropriate.

Also make sure that the dev and test sets come from the same distribution.
