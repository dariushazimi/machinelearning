# Course 2: Hyperparameter tuning

In a 2D example like this, with just two features, X-1 and X-2, you can plot the data and visualize bias and variance. In high dimensional problems, you can't plot the data and visualize division boundary. Instead, there are couple of different metrics, that we'll look at, to try to understand bias and variance
